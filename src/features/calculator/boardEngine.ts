// DISTRIBUTION BOARD SCHEDULE
// ============================================================================
// Turns a circuit list into a board design: what breaker protects what, on
// which rail, behind which incomer.
//
// A BOM says "12 MCBs". Nobody can audit that. A schedule says "Way 4 —
// 16 A Type C, Kitchen 15 A sockets, 2.5 mm²", which a homeowner can hold up
// against the actual board and check. That is the whole point of this module.
//
// Pure. No database, no React, no Prisma — same contract as calculateBOM, so
// the seed, the specs and both UIs can all call it.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A NOTE ON THE BREAKER TABLE
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The specified rule was "1.0 / 1.5 mm² → strictly 10 A Type C". Implemented
// literally that is unsafe in one direction and wrong in another, so it is
// implemented here as a CEILING rather than a fixed value:
//
//   * The engine already puts LIGHTING on a 6 A breaker. Forcing it up to 10 A
//     makes the circuit LESS protected. This feature exists because breakers
//     get over-specified; raising a correctly-sized one would be the same bug
//     with our name on it. So the table caps a rating, and a lower rating that
//     the engine already chose is left alone.
//
//   * Curve is derived from the circuit's own type, not forced to C. Type B
//     trips at 3–5x rated current, Type C at 5–10x. Lighting and general
//     sockets are resistive and belong on B; C exists for inductive inrush
//     (ACs, motors, cooking ranges) where a B curve would nuisance-trip.
//     Forcing lighting onto C would make it slower to trip on a fault.
//
// The ceiling is the safety rule and it is enforced hard: nothing is ever
// allowed to sit above the cap for its conductor, and every clamp is recorded
// in `corrections` so the UI can show what was changed and why.
